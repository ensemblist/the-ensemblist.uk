Unwelcome shroud of the forgotten living,

Oblivionâ€™s dreary drain, where art thou healing?


Why deem suffering perceived as feigned or faux.

Cast down thy humbled pride, and self-reproaching woe.


Time hath not yet taught thy mind, so grasp with grace to seek and sway.

Lest our saddening story of sorrow and decay.
