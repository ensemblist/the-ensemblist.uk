Used to run marathons
And drink Irn Bru
Walk for miles and miles,
Rise early, enjoy the view

Break of dawn, 
Glide through the day
Do anything, do it all
And then it all fades away

And the questions go unanswered
There is no surefire set solution 
And the cure seems so far away

As the sun shines brightly
Dappling through the trees
And the birds glide skyward
On the breeze

Missing it all, lying in bed
In this everlasting night
Awake in this darkness
Body putting on a fight

And the questions go unanswered
There is no surefire set solution 
And the cure seems so far away

And the questions go unanswered
There is no surefire set solution 
And the cure seems so far away
