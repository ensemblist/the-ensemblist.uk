Wife and child have gone away,  
I’m at home alone, working, bills to pay.  

I feel old and I feel tired,  
Lie in bed, risk getting fired.  

Close my eyes, occasionally sleep,  
Never refreshed, I could weep.  

My nose is blocked and my throat is sore,  
I struggle to complete a single chore.  

Everything aches, and my hands cramp,  
Brightness hurts my eyes, turn off lamps,  

Live in the dark and soon to retire,  
Checks and tests that never inspire.  

I don’t want to die, so perhaps just a coma,  
Something to end this constant hangover.  

Switch me off and on again.
