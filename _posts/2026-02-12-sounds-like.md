Like a high-pitched whistle that sends dogs wild,  
like garden sensors scattering cats or birds.  

A pressure builds, a vibration in my head. It overwhelms.  

Migraines. Physical pain. A sense of doom.  

Familiar songs or voices sometimes appease, but often even that becomes too much.  

Only silence will do.
